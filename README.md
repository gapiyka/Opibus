## Q&A

1. What i did?

- Core-cylce implement.
- ResourceSystem, that can be reused in different way (storage space and player's inventory).
- ScriptableObjects for list of sounds for comfortable usage.
- ObjectPool for text popUps.
- Custom sound manager.
- Spread input manager from interfaces (via joystick + via external devices kinda keyboard).

2. What i didn't do:

I left last task about linear interpolation visualization, because i didn't understand task clearly. 
I know what is linear interpolation and for example how it can be replace my realization by coroutines, but what about *visualization* part. 
So i declare or personally I dont know what it is, or task should be more clarified. 
It's okay if i need implement some kind of pipeline where this objects move from one postion to another.
